      "2. Logic: \"Logic\" in these models is used to represent relationships between concepts, ideas, or statements. It helps to formalize reasoning processes by using logical symbols, axioms, and inference rules. This can be achieved through various formalisms like propositional logic, predicate logic, or modal logic.\n",
      "3. Mathematics: \"Mathematics\" in LLM models is employed for representing the structure of natural languages using mathematical concepts and techniques. This may involve applying algebraic structures (e.g., groups, lattices), topological notions (e.g., automata, grammars), or other formalisms to model linguistic phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
